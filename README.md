# networking-project-ospf-vlan-dhcp
A Cisco Packet Tracer project with 3 routers using OSPF, each connected to a switch managing 3 VLANs. Includes DHCP configuration and wireless access point. Successfully tested with ping to verify end-to-end connectivity.
# üåê Networking Project: OSPF with VLAN and DHCP Configuration

This project demonstrates a practical networking setup using **OSPF protocol**, **VLAN segmentation**, and **DHCP services**. The network was designed and simulated using **Cisco Packet Tracer**.

## üìò Project Description

- **Three routers** are connected via **OSPF (Open Shortest Path First)** routing protocol.
- Each router is connected to a **switch**.
- Each switch supports **three different VLANs**, where:
  - Each VLAN contains **one PC** and **one printer**.
  - A **common Access Point** is used to connect VLANs wirelessly.
- **DHCP** is configured on each router to dynamically assign IP addresses to devices in all VLANs.

  ## üß∞ Technologies & Tools

- Cisco Packet Tracer
- OSPF (Routing Protocol)
- VLAN (Virtual LANs)
- DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)
- CLI Configuration (Routers and Switches)

## ‚úÖ Key Features

- Dynamic IP assignment through DHCP
- Segmented network using VLANs for better management and security
- Inter-router communication using OSPF
- Wireless connectivity support for VLANs via a shared access point
- Verified connectivity with successful ping and packet delivery
